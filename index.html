<h1>Description</h1>
<div class="contentblock">
<p>Social network analysis (SNA) encompasses an increasingly central set of methods and theories in the study of social structures. This course will provide an overview of the foundational theories and core measures and methods used in the social-scientific literature. While students will learn to implement their own network analysis using quantitative methods, just as much emphasis will be placed on generating theoretically motivated questions and analysis.</p>
<p>The course is structured as a hybrid of lectures and seminars. Most of the classes will begin with a short presentation by the instructor, but the bulk of the class time will be spent in (structured and unstructured) discussion with your classmates. The success of the course therefore relies on students’ careful readings of the assigned texts and critical engagement with the topics we will cover.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="expectations" class="level1">
<h1>Expectations</h1>
<div class="contentblock">
<p>Students are expected to (<strong>1</strong>) closely read the assigned texts, (<strong>2</strong>) participate in group discussions and worksheets, (<strong>3</strong>) complete (approximately) weekly methods labs, and (<strong>4</strong>) propose and complete a final paper and presentation. Each of these expectations is detailed below.</p>
<section id="reading" class="level2">
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>The assigned readings are the core of the course material, and students are expected to carefully and critically read each assignment <em>before</em> class. To facilitate students’ engagement with the reading and to help prevent students from falling behind, we will use the online tool <a href="https://perusall.com/"><em>Perusall</em></a> for all required readings. <em>Perusall</em> is a reading platform in which students annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. <a href="pages/perusall.html">More information on how <em>Perusall</em> works and how it is integrated into the course is available here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To access <em>Perusall</em> through MyCourses, navigate to <em>Content</em> &gt; <em>Perusall (readings)</em> &gt; <em>Perusall</em>, and then click the “Open Link” button</strong>. This will take you to the <em>Perusall</em> site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through <em>Perusall</em> contact the instructor right away.</p>
<p>Readings will be graded as either complete (1 point) or incomplete (0 points). Student responses must demonstrate a thoughtful and thorough reading of the entire assignment to receive credit. At the end of the semester, the <em>four</em> lowest reading grades will be dropped from the assessment. <strong>Reading assessments will contribute 10% to the final grade for the course</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="class-periods" class="level2">
<h2>Class periods</h2>
<p>Most of the scheduled class periods will follow a three-part structure. We will begin with brief participatory lecture covering the major themes and methods from the required reading. We will then break up into small groups of three to five students to engage in a structured discussion. Finally, we will reconvene to discuss our insights, questions, and connections as a class.</p>
<p>To facilitate class engagement in the remote learning setting, we will use the online tool <a href="https://campuswire.com/">CampusWire</a> to stream lectures and have small-group and class discussions. CampusWire will be the primary means of communicating for the class, and students are encouraged to use it to talk with one another both during class and throughout the rest of the week. Instructions for accessing CampusWire will be posted before the term begins.</p>
<p>The lecture portion of class will be recorded and made available shortly after class. PDF files of the slides will be posted before class.</p>
</section>
<section id="small-group-discussions" class="level2">
<h2>Small-group discussions</h2>
<p>The small-group discussions will be facilitated with short worksheets to help structure conversation and highlight important themes. The worksheets will be straightforward, and they should be used as a starting point for conversation rather than an end goal. I will collect the worksheets at the end of class, which will count toward the ‘participation’ grade described below.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods-labs" class="level2">
<h2>Methods labs</h2>
<p>Most weeks of the term, students will be expected to complete a short lab assignment covering relevant network methods. These labs are intended to give students a basic foundation for quantitative network analysis. The labs will be geared toward analysis in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R statistical language</a>, but students who are proficient in another language (e.g. Python) and can research the appropriate libraries and tools themselves may use that language instead. The labs are required but ungraded (marked simply as ‘completed’ or ‘incomplete’). Each student is responsible for turning in their own lab, but students are strongly encouraged to discuss and collaborate on the labs using CampusWire.</p>
</section>
<section id="independent-research-project" class="level2">
<h2>Independent research project</h2>
<p>Each student will finish an independent research project by the end of the semester. The projects will be graded on the basis of four required assessments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Precis</strong> (Due October 19): This will be a short (no more than one page) description of the research project. It should include a specific research question, a brief description of the data that will be used, and an outline of the theories and methods that will be employed. The purpose of the precis is to motivate the project and to establish its feasibility, not to perform any analyses or to answer any research questions.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal</strong> (Due November 9): Based on the feedback received from the precis, the project proposal will give a more detailed account of the research project. A good proposal will give a thorough account of the paper’s thesis, its theories, data that it will use..</li>
<li><strong>Presentation</strong> (In class, December 7): Each student will give a brief, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">PechaKucha-style</a> presentation of their final project in class, consisting of twenty slides that will automatically advance every twenty seconds. The presentation should describe your research question succinctly, give a clear account of the theories and methods used, and communicate the conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Project write-up</strong> (Due December 17): The writeup for the final project will take the form of a scholarly paper. This should go into careful detail about the project, including a full description of the theoretical frame, exposition and motivation of the data and methods, and a careful, thorough interpretation of the results. It should include tables and figures to illustrate your analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each student should arrange a brief meeting with me early in the term to discuss ideas for their research project and the appropriateness for the course.</p>

<h4>Grade appeals</h4>
<p>Instructors and teaching assistants take the marking of assignments very seriously, and we work diligently to be fair, consistent, and accurate. Nonetheless, mistakes and oversights occasionally happen. If you believe that to be the case, you must adhere to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is a mathematical error simply alert the instructor of the error.</li>
<li>In the case of more substantive appeals, you must:
<ol type="1">
<li>Wait at least 24 hours after receiving your mark.</li>
<li>Carefully re-read your assignment, all guidelines and marking schemes, and the grader’s comments.</li>
<li>If you wish to appeal, you must submit to the instructor a written explanation of why you think your mark should be altered. Please note that upon re-grade your mark may go down, stay the same, or go up.</li>

<div class="syllabus_section_description">
