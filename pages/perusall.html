<h1>How Perusall Works</h1>
<div class="contentblock">
<p><em>Perusall</em> helps you master readings faster, understand the material better, and get more out of your classes. To achieve this goal, you will be collaboratively annotating the assigned texts with others in your class. The help you’ll get and provide your classmates (even if you don’t know anyone personally) will get you past confusions quickly and will make the process more fun. While you read, you’ll receive rapid answers to your questions, help others resolve their questions (which also helps you learn), and advise the instructor how to make class time most productive. You can start a new annotation thread in <em>Perusall</em> by highlighting text, asking a question, or posting a comment; you can also add a reply or comment to an existing thread. Each thread is like a chat with one or more members of your class, and it happens in real time. Your <strong>goals</strong> in annotating each reading assignment are <em>to stimulate discussion by posting good questions or comments</em> and <em>to help others by answering their questions</em>.</p>
<p>Research shows that by annotating thoughtfully, you’ll learn more and get better grades, so here’s what “annotating thoughtfully” means: Effective annotations <em>deeply engage points in the readings, stimulate discussion, offer informative questions or comments, and help others by addressing their questions or confusions</em>. To help you connect with classmates, you can “mention” a classmate in a comment or question to have them notified by email (they’ll also see a notification immediately if online), and you’ll also be notified when your classmates respond to your questions.</p>
<p>For each assignment we will evaluate the annotations you submit on time (see below). Based on the overall body of your annotations, you will receive a score of 1 (complete) if your responses demonstrate a thoughtful and thorough reading of the entire assignment. You will receive a score of 0 (incomplete) if your annotations demonstrate <em>superficial</em> reading of the entire assignment, thoughtful reading of only <em>part</em> of the assignment, or if you do not do the reading at all.</p>
<section id="how-many-annotations-do-i-need-to-enter" class="level2">
<h2>How many annotations do I need to enter?</h2>
<p>When we look at your annotations we want them to reflect the effort you put in your study of the text. It is unlikely that that effort will be reflected by just a few thoughtful annotations per assignment. On the other extreme, 30 per assignment is probably too many, unless a number of them are superficial or short comments or questions (which is fine, because it is OK to engage in chat with your peers). Somewhere in between these two extremes is about right; thoughtful questions or comments that stimulate discussion or thoughtful and helpful answers to other students’ questions will earn you a higher score for the assignment. Note, also, that to lay the foundation for understanding the in-class activities, you must familiarize yourself with each assignment <em>in its entirety</em>. Failing to annotate the entire assignment will result in a lower score.</p>
